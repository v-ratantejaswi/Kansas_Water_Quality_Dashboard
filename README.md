# Comprehensive Water Quality Analysis in Kansas

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze water quality across Kansas by integrating various datasets, including water quality measurements, location information, and socio-economic data. Our goal is to provide insights into the water safety and ecological balance of the region, informing public health and environmental policy.

## Data Source
Data was sourced from the Water Quality Portal, focusing on physical and chemical analysis results from water samples collected across various locations in Kansas. Additional socio-economic data was integrated to provide a broader context for the water quality measurements.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For data processing and analysis.
- Pandas and GeoPandas: For data manipulation and geographical operations.
- Plotly and Dash: For creating interactive visualizations.
- Streamlit: For developing the web-based dashboard.

## Key Features
1. **Data Integration and Cleaning**: Merging various datasets and cleaning them to ensure consistency and reliability for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Using statistical techniques to identify trends and anomalies in water quality.
3. **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and maps that allow users to explore the data interactively.
4. **Socio-Economic Analysis**: Integrating population data to explore correlations between water quality and socio-economic factors.
5. **Threshold Analysis**: Establishing and applying environmental health standards to assess water quality.
